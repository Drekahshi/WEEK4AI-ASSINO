| Premium | 75,001-150,000 | 12% | Premium service tier |
| Luxury | 150,001+ | 20% | Luxury service tier |

**Additional Charges**:
- Base Gas Price: 0.001 KES per unit
- VAT: 16% on (base cost + excise duty)
- Progressive taxation model

## Multi-Agent Orchestration

### AgenticOrchestrator
**Purpose**: Coordinates decisions across all AI agents
